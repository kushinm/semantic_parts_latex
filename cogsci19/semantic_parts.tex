\begin{abstract}

The ability to represent semantically meaningful structure in our environment is a powerful aspect of human visual perception and cognition. 
As a testament to this ability, we effortlessly grasp the correspondence between a sketch of an object and that physical object in the world, even if the sketch is far from realistic. 
How are visual object concepts organized such that they can robustly encode such abstract correspondences?
Here we consider the possibility that this is in part because we readily decompose both objects and sketches into a common set of semantically meaningful parts. 
To evaluate this, we developed a web-based platform to densely annotate the object parts represented in sketches of real-world objects that varied in how detailed they were.  
We found that: \textit{1}, people are highly consistent in how they interpret what individual strokes represent; \textit{2}, single strokes tend to correspond to single parts; \textit{3}, strokes representing the same part tend to be clustered in time during production; and \textit{4}, both more detailed and sparser sketches of the same object emphasized similar part information, although \textit{5}, detailed sketches of different objects tend to be more distinct from one another than sparser ones. 
Taken together, our results support the notion that people deploy their abstract understanding of the compositional part structure of objects in order to select actions to communicate relevant information about them in context. 
More broadly, they highlight the importance of structured knowledge for understanding how pictorial representations convey meaning.

\section{Introduction}

%% revise so that the throughline is clearer: how does the human mind organize visual concepts such that they can be deployed so flexibly? answer: compositionality. what is a good way of probing compositionality? you could use discrimination tasks, but compositional tasks are much more direct. what is good about compositionality? it enables flexibility. how do you probe flexibility? compositional tasks across different contexts. 

When we open our eyes, we do not experience a meaningless array of photons --- instead, we parse the world into people, objects, and their relationships. 
The ability to represent semantically meaningful structure in our environment is a core aspect of human visual perception and cognition \cite{navon1977forest}. 
As a testament to this ability, we effortlessly grasp the correspondence between a sketch of a particular object and that physical object in the world, even if the sketch is far from realistic \cite{eitz2012humans,FanCommon2018}. 
How are visual object concepts organized such that they can robustly encode such abstract correspondences?
Here we explore the hypothesis that this is in part because we readily decompose both objects and sketches into a common set of semantically meaningful parts \cite{biederman1988surface}. 

Recent advances in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence have provided an unprecedentedly clear view into the algorithms used by the brain to extract semantic information from raw visual inputs, exemplified by modern deep learning approaches \cite{yamins2014performance}.
Nevertheless, a major gap remains in elucidating how the feature representations learned by deep learning models can be adapted to emulate the structure and flexibility of human visual semantic knowledge \cite{lake2017building}.
A promising approach to closing this gap may be to combine the learning capacity of deep neural networks with the parsimony and interpretability of structured representations that reflect how visual concepts are organized in the human mind \cite{battaglia2018relational}. 
However, pursuing this strategy relies on a thorough understanding of this conceptual organization and how this organization enables behavioral flexibility.  

The goal of this paper is to contribute to this understanding by probing the expression of visual semantic knowledge in a naturalistic setting that exposes both its structure and flexibility: visual communication via drawing. 
This approach departs from the conventional strategy for inferring the organization of visual object concepts from behavior, which relies upon tasks that elicit judgments about visual inputs, usually with respect to experimenter-defined dimensions. 
By contrast, visual communication tasks permit participants to include any elements they consider relevant to their goals and combine these elements freely, yielding high-dimensional information about how visual semantic knowledge is organized and deployed under a naturalistic task objective. 

Our aim in probing the semantic structure of communicative sketches is to shed light on how the semantic organization of visual object representations supports their flexible expression across contexts. 
Our approach advances recent work \cite{FanCommon2018} that has investigated the production of object sketches to communicate in two ways: first, an explicit focus on compositional semantic structure in sketches, and second, the examination of flexibility in how visual semantic knowledge is expressed in different semantic contexts. 

Towards this end, we developed a web-based platform to densely annotate sketches of real-world objects produced in different semantic contexts, including detailed and simpler sketches of each object. 
Overall, we found that: (1) people are highly consistent in how they interpret what individual strokes represent; (2) single strokes tend to correspond to single parts; (3) strokes representing the same part tend to be clustered in time; and (4) detailed and sparse sketches of the same object emphasized similar part information, although (5) detailed sketches of different objects tend to be more distinct from one another than simpler ones. 
Taken together, our results support the notion that people deploy their abstract understanding of the compositional part structure of objects in order to select actions to communicate relevant information about them in context. 

\section{Methods}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Communicative sketch dataset}
We obtained 1195 sketches of 32 real-world objects from a recent experimental dataset in which participants were paired in an online environment to play a drawing-based reference game \cite{fan2018modeling}.\footnote{All materials and data are available at \url{https://github.com/cogtoolslab/semantic_parts}.}
Objects belonged to one of four basic-level categories (i.e., bird, car, chair, dog), each of which contained eight exemplars. %(Fig.~\ref{refgame_gallery}A).
On each trial of this reference-game experiment, both participants were presented with a shared context containing an array of photorealistic 3D renderings of four objects.   
One participant (i.e., the sketcher) aimed to draw one of these objects -- the target -- so that the other participant (i.e., the viewer) could pick it out from a set of distractor objects (Fig.~\ref{refgame_performance}A). 
Across trials, the similarity of the distractors to the target was manipulated, yielding two types of semantic context: close contexts, where the target and distractors all belonged to the same basic-level category, and far contexts, where the target and distractors belonged to different basic-level categories (Fig.~\ref{refgame_performance}B). 
This context manipulation led sketchers to produce simpler sketches containing fewer strokes and less ink on far trials than on close trials, while still achieving high recognition accuracy in both types of context (Fig.~\ref{refgame_performance}C). %, Fig.~\ref{refgame_gallery}B\&C). 
 
\begin{figure*}

\caption{(A) Target objects. (B) Example object sketches produced in a close context. (C) Example sketches produced in a far context.}
\label{refgame_gallery}
\end{figure*}


Prior work analyzing the semantic properties of such sketch data have represented them as raster images (e.g., \texttt{*.png}), an expedient format for applying modern convolutional neural network architectures \cite{FanCommon2018,sangkloy2016sketchy,yu2017sketch}. 
However, a key limitation of representing sketch only as an image is that one loses information about the inherently sequential and contour-based nature of sketch production. 
Because our goal was to characterize the fine-grained semantic organization of sketch, it was thus crucial for our purposes to represent each sketch instead using a vector image format (i.e., \texttt{*.svg}). 

Each sketch in our dataset is represented as a sequence of individual strokes, where each stroke consists of a sequence of sub-stroke elements, known as splines. 
These splines are parameterized as cubic Bezier curve segments, which are uniquely defined by four points: the initial point, the final point, and two control points that control the spline's curvature.
This data format provides a relatively compact representation of each sketch compared with a rasterized image, while still providing sufficient expressivity to provide an accurate representation. 

\subsection{Semantic part annotation}

Here we developed a novel web-based platform to crowdsource semantic annotations for every spline of every stroke of communicative sketches in our dataset. 

\subsubsection{Participants}
326 participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and provided informed consent in accordance with the Stanford University IRB. 
Participants were provided with a base compensation of \$0.35, plus \$0.002 for every spline they annotated and \$0.02 for every sketch they annotated completely. 

\subsubsection{Task}
Participants were presented with 10 sketches that were randomly sampled from the reference-game dataset. 
Each trial, one of these sketches appeared in the center of the display, above the same array of four objects that the original sketcher had viewed, with one of these objects highlighted as the target (Fig.~\ref{annotation_interface}). 
Thus the participant had full information about which object the sketcher had intended to depict, as well as the identity of the distractors. 
Their goal was to tag each spline with a label corresponding to the part it represented (e.g., seat, leg, back for a chair). 
To facilitate this, participants were provided with a menu of common part labels that were associated with each basic-level category represented in our dataset. 
Once a spline was successfully tagged, it was rendered in the color that the part label was associated with in the part menu. 
However, participants could also generate their own part label if none of the common labels applied.
In total, we collected 3608 annotation trials of 1195 unique sketches.

\subsubsection{Data preprocessing}

To avoid bias when analyzing the relative emphasis that sketchers placed on different part information, we restricted our analyses to annotation trials in which the sketch was completely annotated (i.e., all splines were tagged). 
Moreover, to evaluate inter-annotator reliability, we only examined sketches that were annotated by at least three distinct participants. 
Some of the custom part labels provided by participants were valid, but at a finer grain than or synonymous to other more frequently occurring labels. 
For example, sometimes strokes that represented subparts of the leg of a chair were labeled as `leg support', `foot', and `strut.'
In order to ensure that parts of sketches were segmented at a consistent level of granularity, we manually constructed a part dictionary to map these overly fine-grained part labels to one of the common part labels. 
After applying these preprocessing steps, our annotated dataset consisted of 864 sketches that had been annotated exactly 3 times each, using a set of 24 unique part labels.

\section{Results}

\subsection{How well do different people agree on what strokes represent?}

Perhaps one of the most basic questions our dataset is poised to answer is how often different viewers agreed on what each stroke element in a sketch represented. 
We found that 95.6\% of all splines in our dataset were given the same label by at least two of the three annotators, with 67.8\% of all splines exhibiting complete agreement among all three annotators. 
This suggests that there is a high degree of consistency in how people decompose sketches into semantically meaningful parts. 
In subsequent analyses, we collapsed over inter-annotator variation: we assigned the modal label to splines to which at least two annotators had given the same label; for the remaining 4.4\% of splines, we sampled one of the three labels provided.

\subsection{How strongly do strokes correspond to parts of objects?}

When composing a recognizable sketch of a real-world object, how do people decide what information to convey with each stroke? 
A natural possibility is that there exists a close correspondence between the actions they perform and what parts they know the object possesses. 
Concretely, we hypothesized that for most strokes in our dataset, that all sub-stroke elements would be assigned the same part label. 
However, because the part labels we considered could reasonably apply to multiple sub-parts (e.g., multiple legs on a bird, chair, or dog), we further hypothesized that multiple strokes would frequently be used to represent that part in a single sketch.

To evaluate the first prediction, we determined how many unique part labels were represented across all sub-stroke elements comprising each stroke (Fig.~\ref{stroke_to_part}B). 
We found that there was only one part label associated with 81.6\% of the strokes in our dataset, showing that when participants produced a stroke, most of the time it represented no more than one part of that object. 
There were 18.4\% of strokes were associated with two or more, showing that there are still cases where a single stroke may still be used to represent more than one part (e.g., a single stroke connecting the head and body of a bird, or an armrest and leg of a chair). 
This was slightly more common in sketches produced in far contexts than close contexts (19.4\% vs. 17.6\%). \jefan{This needs additional analysis, i.e., bootstrapping, to evaluate statistical reliability between conditions.}

To evaluate the second prediction, we determined how many strokes were used to represent each part of an object (Fig.~\ref{stroke_to_part}B). 
We found that 46.1\% of parts were depicted using exactly one stroke, 26.0\% using exactly two strokes, 11.3\% using exactly three strokes, 16.6\% using four or more strokes. 
This shows that nearly half the time, a single action was required to depict an entire object part. 
However, the remaining 53.9\% of parts required more than one stroke to depict, owing to those parts that consisted of multiple disconnected subparts within an object (e.g., wheels of a car, paws of a dog).
\jefan{This should be verified in some way by subsetting on those feature columns that actually are likely to contain multiple instances per object.}
The proportion of parts requiring more than one stroke was slightly higher for close sketches (55.8\%) than far sketches (52.0\%), perhaps reflecting the tendency to include more object-diagnostic detail when depicting each part. 
\jefan{This needs additional analysis, i.e., bootstrapping, to evaluate statistical reliability between conditions.}

Overall, these findings suggest that when people have the goal of communicating the identity of an object in a drawing, the information they choose to convey with each stroke is far from arbitrary, but rather is tightly coupled to the compositional part structure of objects. 

\subsection{How often are strokes representing the same part produced in succession?}

\caption{\jefan{Panel B is missing a y-axis label.}(A) Analysis of sequence in which strokes depicting each part were drawn. (B) Comparison of mean length of streaks consisting of strokes that depict the same part with null distribution of permuted stroke sequences.}
\label{stroke_sequence_fig}
\end{figure}


%%% We first coded each stroke in our dataset in terms of its part label. Whenever multiple consecutive strokes that the sketcher had made shared a part-label, we counted the number of such strokes and termed it as a streak length for that part. This process was repeated for every stroke in a given sketch, after which we averaged over all the streak lengths for every part to obtain a single mean streak length value for every sketch in our dataset. To test whether strokes of the same part were reliably being drawn in bunches we scrambgled the order of strokes in each sketch and calculating a 'scrambled' mean streak length. We repeated this scrambling process 1000 times to get a distribution of scrambled mean streak lengths for every sketch.

In the previous section we discovered that for slightly more than half of the parts in each object, more than one stroke was used to depict it. 
This raised the question: to what extent are these multiple strokes depicting the same part being drawn in succession, or being interleaved among strokes corresponding to other parts?

To investigate this, we estimated the mean length of streaks consisting of strokes depicting the same part, and compared this to the mean streak length for permuted stroke sequences. 
We used mean streak length as a proxy for the prevalence of same-part strokes drawn in succession. 
To compute the mean steak length, we encoded each sketch as a sequence of strokes, where each stroke was represented by the modal part label assigned to its sub-stroke elements. 
We restricted this analysis to sketches that consisted of more than one stroke, consisted of more than one part, and contained at least two strokes sharing the same part label (78 out of 864 sketches excluded). 
For every element of the stroke sequence, we recorded the length of the part streak it belonged to. 
If it was immediately followed by a stroke depicting a different part, the streak length would be 1. 
If it was immediately followed by two strokes depicting the same part, before switching to a stroke of a different part, the streak length would be 3. 
We then averaged these streak length values over the entire sequence. 
To evaluate to what extent these mean streak lengths exceeded that expected under a null model in which there was no tendency for same-part strokes to be clustered in time, we compared our empirical estimates of streak length to a null distribution of streak lengths generated by permuting each stroke sequence 1000 times (Fig.~\ref{stroke_sequence_fig}A). 

To evaluate statistical reliability, we computed the z-score of the empirical streak length relative to the permuted streak length distribution for each sketch. 
This reflects the extent to which same-part strokes were clustered in time relative to a sequence with exactly the same distribution of strokes over parts, but in which strokes were produced in random order. 
We found that the empirical streak length was reliably higher for all objects (\jefan{we need a stat for this, like a p-value reflecting the number of times the permuted streak length exceeded the empirical. If this never happened, then we can say ps < 0.001.}), and higher for the close sketches (z-score: 2.58; 95\% CI: [2.26, 2.90]) than far sketches (z-score: 1.56; 95\% CI: [1.38, 1.74]).
Taken together, our results suggest that the procedure by which people convey semantic information when sketching is compositional: frequently, they use a single stroke to convey an entire part; but when they do use multiple strokes to convey a single part, they tend to draw these in succession before moving on to a different part. 

\subsection{How is part information emphasized in different communicative contexts?}

Our findings so far bear on how the way people compose communicative sketches of objects reflects their semantic knowledge of which parts objects are composed of. 
% compositionally organized semantic part
A key consequence of such compositionally organized semantic part knowledge is that it naturally supports flexible expression across different task contexts. 
For example, when communicating about a chair in a context containing objects from other basic-level categories, sketchers may include only the essential information to indicate the presence of certain parts that distinguish it at the category level. 
On the other hand, when communicating about that same chair in a context containing other, perceptually similar chairs, sketchers may emphasize certain distinctive parts (e.g., the number of back slats) that distinguish it at the object level, by applying more strokes and/or more detail in each stroke.



To explore this idea systematically, we asked the following questions: 

what is preserved 

When sketchers aim to produce these sketches that are diagnostic at the object level (in close contexts), 

To what extent do both these more detailed close sketches and sparser far sketches emphasize similar part information? 

Here we ask the following questions: to what extent does this reflect 

% (4) detailed and sparse sketches of the same object emphasized similar part information, although (5) detailed sketches of different objects tend to be more distinct from one another than simpler ones.


% The goal of this paper is to contribute to this understanding by probing the expression of visual semantic knowledge in a naturalistic setting that exposes both its structure and flexibility: visual communication via drawing. 


% We believe that people's concepts of object-categories are structured in a manner that facilitates both flexible recognition and production through a compositional organization of the category's prototypical parts. 
% Our annotated reference game sketches, made in different communicative contexts, serve as a good dataset to test this hypothesis.

% We also hypothesized that while there would be variations in 'style' depending on the communicative context, the organization of parts would remain the same across detailed and sparse sketches. To create a part profile for each sketch, we represented each sketch in our dataset as a 48-dimensional feature vector. 
% 24 of these components captured the number of strokes in a given sketch dedicated to each of the 24 unique part labels in our dataset. 
% The remaining 24 components captured the total arc length of each of the 24 parts. Total arc length, here, serves as a proxy for the total amount of ink expended in drawing all instances of the given part in a sketch. 



% We z-scored each feature dimension to map these values to the same scale.

%  across sketches such that each component in a sketch was represented as its z-score relative to the same component in all other sketches. 
% In order to compare differences between sketches of the same target across contexts, we averaged feature vectors for sketches of each target by context condition to create 64 (32 objects * 2 conditions) averaged object vectors.
% We compared sparse and detailed sketches of the same object using these feature representations. 



% We once again applied a softmax function across object vectors, standardizing features to the same scale for meaningful comparison.
% we calculated the Euclidean norm of each object vector. The difference in mean Euclidean norms between close and far sketches was 0.072, and 28 out of 32 of the object vectors had higher Euclidean norms for detailed sketches relative to sparse sketches. We predicted that the rank ordering of feature weights might be preserved between detailed and sparse sketches. The Spearman Rank-Order correlation coefficient between detailed and sparse object features for all objects was statistically significantly positive. This indicated that the feature weight rank orderings was preserved between detailed and sparse sketches. The higher norms for detailed sketches indicates that while the part-specific profile may be preserved between context conditions, detailed sketches tend to be exaggerated in our feature space relative to sparse sketches.

% For each category of objects and context condition, we calculated the Euclidean norm of the object vectors and Euclidean pairwise distances between object vectors. 
% Using the mean of the norm and the standard deviation of pairwise distances, we calculated the coefficient of variation for detailed and sparse sketches by category. Detailed sketches had higher coefficients of variation for all categories \kushin{would report CV difference between close and far maybe?}.
% These results show that sparse sketches within a category are more similar to each other than detailed sketches are to each other. 
% The exaggeration in features in detailed sketches appear to make them not only distinct from sparse sketches, but from other detailed sketches of the same category as well.
